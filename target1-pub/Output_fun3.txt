First Step : Do the needful installations
1. Install Java jdk -8
2. Download IntelliJ
3. Others as required ...


Steps:-

1. Declare LatticeElement Interface which has all possible methods like join,transfer,equality etc.(let's name it LatticeElement.java)

2. Implementing Transfer function of Interval Analysis Program by implementing LatticeElement (let's name it IALatticeElement.java)

3.We have another class called ProgramPoint it is used to represent points in Kildall in program point every program point has some statement, whether it is marked or not ,it further successor points etc. (let's name it ProgramPoint.java)

4. Since in Killdal we need to code independent of any lattice so after extraction from the given code that is soot we will get control flow of the graph we need to do some preprocessing before sending it to Kildall's code so let's name this file has (IALatticePreProcess.java)

5. IALatticePreProcess file will return the list of program points which we will pass on to the Kildall File which will then generate the desired result (Kildall.java).

# <Dir> is the directory that contains the target program.
# <MainClass> is the name of the class that contains the "main" method. 
# <TargetClass> is the class that contains the "target" method
# <TargetMethod> is the target method. You need to analyze this method and
# its callees (i.e., treat this method as if it is your main method).

# For simplicity you can assume that all the classes of your program are in
# a single package, which is the "default" (i.e., unnamed) package.
